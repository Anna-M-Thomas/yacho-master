  --We want share alike (international) creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/
  --Not non derivative //creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ which would mean we can't alter the recording

- How to download multiple files without being terrible? Whatever, let's do a for loop.
- OK, I don't know what's wrong with for loops in node but let's do foreach instead in groups of 10
